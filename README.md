k-means algorithm revised to reduce computational complexity
A revised code for k-means clustering algorithm written. 
Here instead creating direct clusters using list data-structures in R, a simple 1-d array (vector datastructure in r) is used to represnt the cluser of an instance. 
E-M algorithm for k-means is ran on these arrays which reduces code complexities.
